3. **Set up the MongoDB Database:**

   - Shopparel uses MongoDB as its database. Follow these steps to set up the database:

     - Ensure MongoDB is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

     - Create a new MongoDB database for Shopparel.

     - Configure the database connection in the `.env` file by adding the MongoDB connection URI. For example:

       ```
       MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/shopparel
       ```

     - Optionally, you can use a tool like MongoDB Compass to visually manage your database and collections.

     - Seed the database with initial data if needed. You can use a script or manually insert data into collections.

Now, your MongoDB database is ready for Shopparel. Adjust the connection details and other configurations as per your environment.

4. Configure environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file and set up variables like `JWT_SECRET`, etc.
